# Configuration for the low-density software chooser
---
# The packagechooser writes a GlobalStorage value for the choice that
# has been made. The key is *packagechooser_<id>*. If *id* is set here,
# it is substituted into the key name. If it is not set, the module's
# instance name is used; see the *instances* section of `settings.conf`.
# If there is just one packagechooser module, and no *id* is set,
# resulting GS key is probably *packagechooser_packagechooser*.
#
# The GS value is a comma-separated list of the IDs of the selected
# packages, or an empty string if none is selected.
#
# id: ""

# Software selection mode, to set whether the software packages
# can be chosen singly, or multiply.
#
# Possible modes are "optional", "required" (for zero or one)
# or "optionalmultiple", "requiredmultiple" (for zero-or-more
# or one-or-more).
mode: required

# Human-visible strings in this module. These are all optional.
# The following translated keys are used:
#  - *step*, used in the overall progress view (left-hand pane)
#
# Each key can have a [locale] added to it, which is used as
# the translated string for that locale. For the strings
# associated with the "no-selection" item, see *items*, below
# with the explicit id "".
#
labels:
    step: "Office Suite"
    step[de]: "Office-Paket"

# Items to display in the chooser. In general, this should be a
# pretty short list to avoid overwhelming the UI. This is a list
# of objects, and the items are displayed in list order.
#
# Either provide the data for an item in the list (using the keys
# below), or use existing AppData XML files, or use AppStream cache
# as a source for the data.
#
# For data provided by the list: the item has an id, which is used in
# setting the value of *packagechooser_<module-id>*. The following fields
# are mandatory:
#
#  - *id* : ID for the product. The ID "" is special, and is used for
#           "no package selected". Only include this if the mode allows
#           selecting none.
#  - *package* : Package name for the product. While mandatory, this is
#                not actually used anywhere.
#  - *name* : Human-readable name of the product. To provide translations,
#             add a *[lang]* decoration as part of the key name,
#               e.g. `name[nl]` for Dutch.
#             The list of usable languages can be found in
#             `CMakeLists.txt` or as part of the debug output of Calamares.
#  - *description* : Human-readable description. These can be translated
#                    as well.
#  - *screenshot* : Path to a single screenshot of the product. May be
#                   a filesystem path or a QRC path,
#                     e.g. ":/images/no-selection.png".
#
# Use the empty string "" as ID / key for the "no selection" item if
# you want to customize the display of that item as well.
#
# For data provided by AppData XML: the item has an *appdata*
# key which points to an AppData XML file in the local filesystem.
# This file is parsed to provide the id (from AppData id), name
# (from AppData name), description (from AppData description paragraphs
# or the summary entries), and a screenshot (the default screenshot
# from AppData). No package is set (but that is unused anyway).
#
# AppData may contain IDs that are not useful inside Calamares,
# and the screenshot URL may be remote -- a remote URL will not
# be loaded and the screenshot will be missing. An item with *appdata*
# **may** specify an ID or screenshot path, as above. This will override
# the settings from AppData.
#
# For data provided by AppStream cache: the item has an *appstream*
# key which matches the AppStream identifier in the cache (e.g.
# *org.kde.kwrite.desktop*). Data is retrieved from the AppStream
# cache for that ID. The package name is set from the AppStream data.
#
# An item for AppStream may also contain an *id* and a *screenshot*
# key which will override the data from AppStream.
